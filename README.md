# Developer Task Assignment
Start the backend server running **composer install** then **php artisan serve** command
Backend should be running on 8000 port or change the port value at *App.js*

To start front end project run **npm i**  then **npm start**
Browse http://localhost:3000/ 

Some rules applied by me to the task.
- Developer with lower difficulty can't be assigned to higher difficulty job.
- If developer with higher difficulty assigned to lower difficulty job, duration doesn't change.
- Wrote the algorithm to handle the logic with more developers.

**Sometimes assigning can take long time. Depends on the complexity of dataset.
